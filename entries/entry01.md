# Entry 1

  The Freedom Project we are workiing on is so that we choose a topic for example, science, math, engineering, etc, that we are interested in. The purpose of this project was to choose a topic and to research about it and to make a website informing others with the topic we chose, and to keep in mind how it'll affect others. In my blogs I will be talking about ecology because that's the topic I'm interested in. In my blogs I will include how ecology will have an affect on others, ecology is the study of the relationships between living organisims including humans and how we can use that information to make the environment healthy again. Being open to information about ecology could impact society in a postive way, societies will see how we're affectig the environment and what things we can do to find a solution for it.
